Intended Value & Expected Outcome
	•	Goal: Onboard SPLMT and GRFCL applications into the Orchestra framework and complete the monitoring sunrise under official app IDs across all OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) Line-of-Business (LOB) clusters.
	•	Value: Ensure compliance with Wells Fargo monitoring policies and regulations. Achieve consistent and automated deployment of metrics collection pipelines to Grafana Cloud and Splunk Observability using Harness pipelines.
	•	Outcome:
	•	Monitoring solution will be officially registered under SPLMT and GRFCL app IDs.
	•	We can successfully validate metric ingestion, environment tagging, and dashboards.
	•	Monitoring can be performed under authorized application mnemonic identifiers without impediments.

⸻

Phases
	1.	Register SPLMT and GRFCL as Application IDs in Orchestra.
	2.	Associate OCP LOB clusters with each application.
	3.	Identify SPLMT and GRFCL environment targets and related cluster infrastructure.
	4.	Configure Harness pipelines for:
	•	Metrics collection deployment.
	•	Environment tagging.
	•	Labeling for Grafana and Splunk dashboards.
	5.	Validate deployment and ensure successful ingestion and visualization.
	6.	Document steps for reusability.

⸻

Testability & Feasibility
	•	Testability:
Metrics ingestion and dashboard validation across clusters via SPLMT and GRFCL identifiers.
	•	Feasibility:
High — reusable Harness pipeline templates and tagging conventions are available.

⸻

Dependencies
	•	No external dependencies identified. Internal teams (Infra, Monitoring, Harness) are aligned.

⸻

Risks & Unknowns
	•	Risk:
	•	Environment-specific onboarding or Helm deployments may delay overall metrics validation.
	•	Cluster-level configurations may differ and require adjustments.

⸻

Technology Partners
	•	CTO Sunrise Consultant
	•	Harness DevOps Engineers
	•	Observability Platform SMEs

Weekly syncs planned to validate progress, unblock issues, and ensure delivery.

⸻

Performance & Nonfunctional Requirements
	•	Ensure solution is scalable across all environments and future applications.
	•	Tagging and metrics ingestion pipelines must maintain high availability and minimal delay.
