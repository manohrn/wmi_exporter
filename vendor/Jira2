Description:
This story aims to onboard the SPLMT and GRFCL applications into the Orchestra framework, including all relevant OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) line-of-business (LOB) cluster infrastructure. The onboarding will be facilitated through Harness pipelines to enable streamlined and automated deployment of the metrics collection solution into Grafana Cloud.

Key activities include:
	•	Registering SPLMT and GRFCL as application IDs in Orchestra
	•	Associating relevant OCP LOB clusters with each application
	•	Updating or creating Harness deployment pipelines for metrics solution
	•	Validating successful deployment and data visibility in Grafana Cloud
	•	Ensuring consistent tagging and environment labeling for filtering and dashboarding

⸻

Design:
Placeholder: Include a diagram showing app ID and infra mapping into Orchestra, Harness deployment flow, and metrics path to Grafana Cloud.

⸻

Technical Implementation:
	•	Identify SPLMT and GRFCL environment targets and related OCP clusters
	•	Configure these applications and infra components in Orchestra
	•	Extend or build Harness pipelines to deploy metrics exporters and config
	•	Register applications with environment-specific tags for visualization in Grafana
	•	Verify that metrics solution is deployed and operational across all clusters
	•	Document steps and configurations for reusability

⸻

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	SPLMT and GRFCL app IDs are onboarded to Orchestra
	•	All OCP LOB clusters tied to these apps are registered and mapped
	•	Harness pipelines are updated or created to support deployment
	•	Metrics are deployed successfully and visible in Grafana Cloud
	•	Metrics are properly tagged and grouped for filtering
	•	Onboarding documentation is completed and validated
