Key Risks and Blockers
	1.	Infrastructure Readiness – Ensure resources are pre-provisioned.
	2.	Third-Party Dependencies – APIs, integrations, or vendor delays.
	3.	Security & Compliance Approvals – Fast-track necessary reviews.
	4.	Limited Testing Window – Migration and validation must run in parallel.
	5.	Stakeholder Sign-offs – Must be pre-aligned to prevent delays.

Risk Mitigation Plan

✅ Parallel Execution – Deployment, migration, and testing overlap.
✅ Daily Standups – Rapid issue resolution.
✅ Pre-approved Migration Plan – Reduces last-minute security/compliance roadblocks.
✅ Early Stakeholder Engagement – Avoid last-minute delays.
