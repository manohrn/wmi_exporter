Step-by-Step Fix for Cluster Join Timeout (Windows Servers)

1. Choose a Cluster Port (e.g., 12345)
Use a consistent port on both servers for cluster communication.

2. Open TCP and UDP Port Inbound on Both Servers
Run the following commands on both servers in PowerShell (as Administrator):

# Allow inbound TCP on port 12345
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Agent Cluster TCP 12345" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=12345

# Allow inbound UDP on port 12345
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Agent Cluster UDP 12345" dir=in action=allow protocol=UDP localport=12345
3. Optional: Allow Outbound Rules for Good Measure
# Allow outbound TCP/UDP (usually allowed by default, but to be safe)
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Agent Cluster TCP 12345 Outbound" dir=out action=allow protocol=TCP localport=12345
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Agent Cluster UDP 12345 Outbound" dir=out action=allow protocol=UDP localport=12345
4. Validate Connectivity
Run from one server to the other:

Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <peer-server-fqdn> -Port 12345
You should now see:

TcpTestSucceeded : True
5. Restart Grafana Agent on Both Servers
Make sure each server has a cluster block in its .river file like:

Example for Agent A:

cluster "agent_cluster" {
  node_name     = "agent-a"
  bind_addr     = "0.0.0.0:12345"
  join_members  = ["agent-b.example.com:12345"]
}
Example for Agent B:

cluster "agent_cluster" {
  node_name     = "agent-b"
  bind_addr     = "0.0.0.0:12345"
  join_members  = ["agent-a.example.com:12345"]
}
Use IP address instead of FQDN if DNS is unreliable.
6. Check Grafana Agent Logs
Look for:

cluster joined with 1 nodes
If still failing:

Share logs using --log.level=debug
Confirm netstat -ano | findstr :12345 shows LISTENING
Confirm Test-NetConnection passes
