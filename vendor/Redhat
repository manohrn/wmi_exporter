I hope you’re doing well.

As we continue to work closely with the CloudOps and Engineering teams to enable observability for platform metrics and alerting, I believe gaining deeper expertise in Red Hat technologies would further strengthen our contributions—especially given our reliance on OpenShift and related tooling.

I would like to request support in obtaining a license or access to pursue Red Hat certifications. This would not only enhance my capabilities but also add value to our platform observability initiatives through improved operational efficiency and automation alignment.

Please let me know if this can be considered, or if there’s a formal process I should follow.

Thank you for your continued support
