As part of the Observability and Foundational Automations team, we are working closely with CloudOps and Engineering to enhance platform metrics and alerting across our OpenShift environments.

To further strengthen our technical capabilities, I’d like to request access to a Red Hat certification license. This will help deepen our expertise and better support automation and observability initiatives aligned with enterprise goals.

Please let me know if this can be facilitated or if there’s a formal process to initiate the request.
