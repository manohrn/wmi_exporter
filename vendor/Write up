Technical Write-Up: Handling Grafana Agent Down Issue

Overview

This document outlines the steps to diagnose, troubleshoot, and resolve instances where Grafana Agent goes down in a production environment. The objective is to ensure minimal downtime and maintain continuous observability.

1. Issue Identification

When Grafana Agent goes down, it affects the collection and forwarding of metrics, logs, and traces. The impact depends on its role in the observability stack:
	•	Metrics: Delay or loss in Prometheus metrics.
	•	Logs: Disruption in log forwarding.
	•	Traces: Missing traces affecting distributed tracing.

Indicators of a Grafana Agent failure:
	1.	No metrics/logs/traces visible in Grafana dashboards.
	2.	No response from the Agent’s HTTP endpoint (/metrics, /-/ready).
	3.	Service is in a stopped/crashed state (systemctl status grafana-agent).
	4.	High error rate in logs (journalctl -u grafana-agent -f).
	5.	Increased scrape errors in Prometheus (up metric = 0).

2. Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

Common reasons for Grafana Agent going down include:

a. Configuration Issues
	•	Invalid Config: Misconfigured YAML file (/etc/grafana-agent.yaml).
	•	Broken Service Discovery: Issues with Prometheus/Log Service discovery.
	•	Invalid DSN (for databases): Incorrect connection strings.

b. Resource Constraints
	•	High Memory Usage: OOM Killer terminating the agent (dmesg | grep OOM).
	•	High CPU Usage: Agent consuming excessive CPU (top or htop).
	•	Disk Space Exhaustion: Logs or WAL data filling up (df -h).

c. Service & Dependency Failures
	•	Agent Crashed: Segmentation faults, panics (journalctl -xe -u grafana-agent).
	•	Network Connectivity Issues: DNS resolution failures, firewall blocking ports.
	•	Dependency Issues: Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, or external DBs being unavailable.

d. Version or Plugin Issues
	•	Recent Upgrades: Incompatibility after updates.
	•	Plugins/Integrations: Faulty Prometheus remote write endpoint or Loki target.

3. Immediate Actions
	1.	Check service status:

systemctl status grafana-agent

If not running, restart:

systemctl restart grafana-agent


	2.	Check logs for errors:

journalctl -u grafana-agent -n 50 --no-pager

	•	Look for configuration errors, memory exhaustion, or crashes.

	3.	Validate configuration:

grafana-agent check-config /etc/grafana-agent.yaml

	•	Fix any misconfigurations before restarting.

	4.	Check resource usage:

top -p $(pgrep grafana-agent)

	•	If excessive memory usage, consider increasing system limits.

	5.	Verify Prometheus scrape status:
	•	Check Prometheus targets:

curl -s http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets | jq .


	•	If state is down, investigate further.

	6.	Ensure dependencies are reachable:

curl -v <remote_write_endpoint>
curl -v <loki_url>
curl -v <tempo_url>

	•	Network/firewall issues can prevent agent from sending data.

	7.	Check for OS-level issues:
	•	Verify system logs:

dmesg | tail -20


	•	Look for OOM killer logs or hardware failures.

	8.	Manually start agent with debug mode:

grafana-agent -config.file=/etc/grafana-agent.yaml -log.level=debug

	•	Helps detect misconfiguration issues.

4. Resolution & Long-Term Fixes

a. Configuration Fixes
	•	Ensure valid YAML before restarting.
	•	Use environment variables to avoid hardcoded secrets.
	•	Optimize Prometheus scraping intervals to reduce load.

b. Resource Optimization
	•	Increase system memory or CPU if the agent is running out of resources.
	•	Limit WAL retention if logs/metrics are overwhelming disk.
	•	Monitor Agent process using systemd watchdog.

c. Network & Dependency Fixes
	•	Ensure connectivity to Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, or external systems.
	•	Fix firewall rules to allow agent traffic.

d. Auto-Recovery Strategies
	•	Enable systemd auto-restart:

sudo systemctl edit grafana-agent

Add:

[Service]
Restart=always
RestartSec=5s


	•	Setup alerts for failures:
	•	Prometheus Alerting Rule:

- alert: GrafanaAgentDown
  expr: up{job="grafana-agent"} == 0
  for: 5m
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: "Grafana Agent Down"
    description: "Grafana Agent instance {{ $labels.instance }} is not responding."


	•	Log rotation & cleanup:
	•	Ensure logs don’t fill up disk:

logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/grafana-agent

5. Preventive Measures

Issue	Prevention
Configuration Errors	Validate configs with grafana-agent check-config before deploying
Resource Exhaustion	Monitor CPU/memory with Prometheus and alerts
Service Failures	Enable systemd auto-restart & set up alerting
Network Issues	Automate connectivity checks via curl & alerts
Upgrades Breaking Compatibility	Test updates in a non-prod environment first

6. Escalation & Support

If the issue persists after applying these fixes, escalate with:
	1.	Grafana Agent Logs (journalctl -u grafana-agent -n 100)
	2.	Prometheus Logs (if applicable)
	3.	Network Connectivity Report (ping/traceroute to dependencies)
	4.	Resource Usage Report (top, free -m, df -h)

Escalation Path:
	•	Internal Support: Reach out to the SRE/Observability team.
	•	Grafana Community: Grafana Forums
	•	Enterprise Support: If using Grafana Cloud, raise a support ticket.

7. Conclusion

By following these structured diagnostic and resolution steps, we can ensure quick recovery from Grafana Agent failures and reduce downtime in our monitoring ecosystem. Implementing preventive measures such as alerts, automated restarts, and resource optimizations will further enhance the resilience of our observability stack.
