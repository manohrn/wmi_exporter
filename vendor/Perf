Successes and Achievements

In the first half of this performance year, Iâ€™ve made significant contributions across observability automation, platform integration, team support, and innovation. Key highlights include:
	â€¢	IPE Connect API Integrations (Stretch Goal):
Outside regular work hours, I designed and delivered scalable APIs to onboard ThousandEyes and custom metric data into the IPE Connect platform. This enabled real-time observability integration for critical external monitoring data and supported business teams in making faster, data-driven decisions.
	â€¢	Kafka Metrics Onboarding Automation:
Led the design and implementation of end-to-end Kafka metric onboarding automation, eliminating the need for manual configuration and reducing effort by an estimated 15,000+ engineering hours annually. The solution supports all OCP clusters and enables self-service metric provisioning for LOBs like CT, CCIBT, TCOO, and DTI.
	â€¢	Custom MSSQL Metrics Onboarding for Dev Environments:
Built an extensible pipeline to collect and onboard custom SQL query-based metrics from MSSQL, enabling monitoring of deep database health indicators. This is now being used by Dev environments and is ready for PROD rollout.
	â€¢	Splunk Observability Cloud (Non-Prod) Enablement:
Delivered onboarding for all OCP environments. Worked with Nate to design a highly available Target Allocator architecture to prevent data loss during collector disruptions. Also onboarded CI/CD pipelines for Splunk and Grafana Cloud apps to reduce deployment friction.
	â€¢	SiteScope to Prometheus Migration:
Completed a large-scale migration of over 15,000 SiteScope monitors (ping, port, zLinux) to Prometheus, supporting the OpenText tool decommission effort and aligning with a $1.5M cost savings initiative. This migration has ensured a modern, scalable monitoring footprint for both Windows and Linux systems.
	â€¢	Toolkit Exporter and ITRS Decommissioning:
Created a unified Toolkit Exporter package for Windows and Linux to replace legacy ITRS monitoring. Also implemented auto-config update logic via Agent Management and MSSP integrationsâ€”eliminating manual edits and configuration drift.
	â€¢	IBM MQ Observability:
Partnered with Madhu to complete a POC for IBM MQ metrics onboarding, and contributed to architecture design decisions for scalable message queue telemetry integration.
	â€¢	Compliance & Audit Participation:
Played a key role in Somany internal and external audits, delivering precise metric and label data across observability stacks. Ensured we met governance and security expectations across the stack, particularly for GRFCL and SOLLY environments.
	â€¢	Agent Reliability Fix for 33,000 Windows Servers:
Developed and deployed a PowerShell remediation package to fix Grafana Agent startup issues across 33k+ servers, coordinating with Windows and packaging teams to ensure zero customer impact.
	â€¢	Hackathon & AI/ML Innovations:
Participated in the Hackathon, where I explored LLMs, RAG, and anomaly detection models. I also experimented with Grafana Cloudâ€™s AI forecasting features to project capacity trends and metric baselines.
	â€¢	Leadership & Representation:
Singlehandedly led Developer Day in Bangalore, representing all ITSO products. Took ownership of team planning, customer walkthroughs, and tech showcases.
	â€¢	Team Collaboration:
Regularly supported ARE team members in every sprint, helping unblock technical items and close pending backlogs. My contribution helped ensure timely deliverables across team-owned observability stories.
	â€¢	Certifications & Continuous Learning:
Self-learned and completed certifications in tools like ThousandEyes, Aternity, AppDynamics, Amelia, Splunk Cloud, and BigPanda, expanding my scope across modern AIOps and DX platforms.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Areas of Focus

To further mature our observability and automation posture, my near-term focus will include:
	â€¢	Production Enablement of MSSQL/Kafka Automation:
Transitioning MSSQL and Kafka onboarding frameworks to PROD environments. This includes adding validation, rollback mechanisms, and governance hooks to ensure resiliency.
	â€¢	Enhancing Observability APIs:
Extend the APIs built for IPE Connect to support plug-and-play integration for additional metric types (e.g., business KPIs, synthetic metrics), enabling broader adoption.
	â€¢	Platform Resilience & DR:
Convert lessons learned from events like Oxmoor failover into reusable DR playbooks for agent, collector, and API recovery processes.
	â€¢	LLM-Based RCA & Auto-Triage:
Experiment with incorporating LLMs for anomaly summarization, automated root cause correlation, and integration with notification pipelines (e.g., BigPanda, Slack, ServiceNow).
	â€¢	Agent Management Self-Service Models:
Design and pilot agent onboarding UI models for Windows/Linux environments to further reduce reliance on centralized config updates.
	â€¢	Scaling Team Impact:
Continue mentoring ARE team members and contributing to shared observability modules, ensuring knowledge growth and consistency in delivery quality.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Risk Overlay
	â€¢	Error Prevention by Design:
All automation scripts (Kafka, Toolkit, MSSQL) were built with safety guards, input validation, and auto-rollback logic to reduce human error and avoid config misalignment.
	â€¢	Grafana Agent Recovery at Scale:
Proactively remediated startup failures across 33,000+ Windows nodes, avoiding the risk of silent metric loss. Solution included safety checks and rollback support.
	â€¢	Resilient Architecture Decisions:
Ensured the Target Allocator for Splunk OTel was built to handle collector failovers without metric drop, supporting non-prod reliability.
	â€¢	Audit & Compliance-Ready Data Practices:
Provided reliable, pre-validated observability data for Somany external/internal audits, reducing compliance risk for regulated environments (GRFCL, SOLLY).
	â€¢	Sprint Risk Mitigation:
Provided ongoing support to ARE team members, helping clear sprint blockers before they impacted deadlines or delivery quality.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Overall Summary

This cycle has been deeply impactful, both technically and strategically. Iâ€™ve contributed to automation at scale, cross-platform integrations, compliance assurance, and team-wide delivery acceleration. I stretched beyond working hours when required (e.g., IPE Connect API integration) and took full ownership of deliverables like SiteScope decommissioning and Grafana agent remediation.

As a Principal Engineer, I continued to grow my knowledge base through new tool certifications, hands-on architecture design, and customer collaboration across the enterprise. I remain committed to elevating our observability strategyâ€”through automation, resilience, and AI-driven insightsâ€”and enabling the broader team to succeed through shared innovation.
