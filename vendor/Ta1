Absolutely — let’s walk through the complete detailed flow of how consistent hashing works in the Target Allocator when used with Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector replicas, with the example of 100 targets and 3 collectors.

High-Level Goal

We want to assign 100 targets (pods, services, etc.) to 3 collector agents using consistent hashing in such a way that:
Load is fairly balanced
Only a few targets are reassigned when collectors are added or removed
Full Detailed Flow

STEP 1: Discovery — Targets and Collectors
a. Targets

These are discovered from Kubernetes using kubernetes_sd_config
For example:
target-1, target-2, ..., target-100
b. Collectors

These are Splunk OTel Collector agents registered with the Target Allocator.
For example:
otel-collector-0, otel-collector-1, otel-collector-2
STEP 2: Hashing — Map to Virtual Ring
a. Create a Hash Ring (0 to 359 degrees)

We use SHA-256 or similar to hash both collectors and targets.

Example:
Entity	SHA-256 Hash	Position on Ring (%360)
otel-collector-0	99d28a...	50
otel-collector-1	b3c7f1...	150
otel-collector-2	f1d88c...	300
target-1	12a6ff...	100
target-2	88291d...	280
target-3	7d39fa...	355
STEP 3: Assignment Rule — Clockwise Matching
Each target is assigned to the first collector clockwise on the ring after its position.
Let’s apply that:

target-1 at 100 → next collector is otel-collector-1 at 150 → assigned to collector-1
target-2 at 280 → next collector is otel-collector-2 at 300 → assigned to collector-2
target-3 at 355 → past 300, so wrap around → next collector is at 50 → assigned to collector-0
STEP 4: Target Allocator Stores Assignments
Now the Target Allocator knows:

collector-0:
  - target-3
  - target-10
  - target-97
  ...
collector-1:
  - target-1
  - target-6
  ...
collector-2:
  - target-2
  - target-8
  ...
STEP 5: Collectors Poll the Allocator
Each collector is configured to poll:

extensions:
  target_allocator:
    endpoint: http://<allocator-service>:80
    collector_id: ${POD_NAME}
Each collector says:

"I am otel-collector-1. Which targets should I scrape?"
Allocator responds with:

“Here’s your list: target-1, target-6, target-42...”
STEP 6: Agents Start Scraping
Each agent receives only its assigned targets and starts scraping metrics at the configured interval (e.g., every 30s).

STEP 7: Collector Down Event
Let’s say otel-collector-2 crashes.

What happens:

Targets previously assigned to collector-2 (say, 24 of them) are reassigned to the remaining collectors
Example:
12 go to collector-0
12 go to collector-1
Only 24% of targets move. Other 76% stay put.
STEP 8: Collector Added Event
Now you add a new replica: otel-collector-3

It gets placed at position (e.g., 220°). Some targets between 150° and 300° now fall closer to 220°, so they shift to the new collector.

Only ~8–10 targets move from old collectors to the new one — smooth and efficient rebalancing.
Benefits of This Flow

High scalability — more collectors can be added or removed without reassigning everything
Load-balanced — thanks to evenly spaced positions on the ring
Minimal disruption — only targets near the affected collector change
Visual Summary (Simplified)

HASH RING (0–359°)
[50] collector-0
[150] collector-1
[300] collector-2

Target-3 (355°) → wraps to → collector-0
Target-20 (120°) → → collector-1
Target-66 (290°) → → collector-2
Would you like me to generate an actual diagram of the ring with these placements? Or simulate what happens step-by-step as collectors fail/join?

Yes

Consistent Hashing - 3 Collectors
Consistent Hashing - After Adding Collector-3 (220°)
Here are two visual diagrams showing how consistent hashing works with your setup:

Diagram 1: With 3 Collectors

Blue circles are collectors placed on the ring:
otel-collector-0 at 50°
otel-collector-1 at 150°
otel-collector-2 at 300°
Red crosses are targets:
Each target is assigned to the next collector clockwise.
Target Assignments:
target-1 (100°) → collector-1
target-2 (280°) → collector-2
target-3 (355°) → wraps → collector-0
target-4 (60°) → collector-1
target-5 (160°) → collector-2
target-6 (310°) → wraps → collector-0
Diagram 2: After Adding otel-collector-3 at 220°

Now you have 4 collectors:

otel-collector-3 added at 220°
What Changed:
Some targets (e.g. target-5) that were originally assigned to collector-2 now fall before 220°, and are reassigned to collector-3
Only the targets between 150° and 300° (i.e. between collector-1 and collector-2) are possibly affected
This demonstrates that consistent hashing only reassigns a small set of targets when a new collector is added — instead of reshuffling everything
