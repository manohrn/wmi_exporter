Risk Area,Potential Impact,Mitigation Plan
Firewall Restrictions for ICMP & TCP Probes,Blackbox Exporter unable to probe targets due to blocked firewall rules, leading to incomplete monitoring coverage.,✅ Identify and document required ICMP and TCP port rules before migration.  ✅ Work with network/security teams to pre-approve and implement firewall rules.  ✅ Conduct pre-migration network validation to confirm Blackbox Exporter connectivity.  ✅ Automate firewall rule verification using scripts before final rollout.
SiteScope to Prometheus Blackbox Parity Issues,Potential feature gaps or differences in alerting mechanisms may result in monitoring inconsistencies.,✅ Perform side-by-side monitoring for 2 weeks to compare SiteScope vs. Prometheus Blackbox metrics.  ✅ Define alerting equivalence between SiteScope and Prometheus to avoid false positives/negatives.  ✅ Engage stakeholders for final validation before decommissioning SiteScope.
Configuration & Target Discovery Challenges,Manual configuration errors or missing target endpoints may lead to gaps in monitoring coverage.,✅ Automate target discovery using service discovery mechanisms (e.g., Kubernetes, Consul, or static file-based configs).  ✅ Pre-test all critical endpoints before migration.  ✅ Implement templated configurations to standardize Blackbox Exporter probes.
Latency & Performance Differences,SiteScope and Prometheus Blackbox may have different probe intervals, impacting expected response times.,✅ Benchmark response time differences between SiteScope and Blackbox Exporter.  ✅ Tune probe intervals in Blackbox Exporter to match SiteScope SLAs.  ✅ Leverage caching or distributed probes for improved efficiency.
Alerting & Integration with Existing Dashboards,Delays or misconfigurations in integrating Blackbox metrics into Grafana, Prometheus Alertmanager, or other tools.,✅ Predefine alerting rules in Prometheus and validate against SiteScope alerts.  ✅ Conduct live failover testing to confirm alerts are triggered correctly.  ✅ Update dashboards & documentation to reflect the new monitoring setup.
Stakeholder Adoption & Training,Teams unfamiliar with Prometheus Blackbox may struggle to interpret results or troubleshoot issues.,✅ Provide hands-on training sessions for operations and engineering teams.  ✅ Create quick-reference guides & SOPs for managing Blackbox probes.  ✅ Host office hours or Q&A sessions post-migration to address concerns.
