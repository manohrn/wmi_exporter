Hi Mohan,

I would like to schedule a one-on-one with Todd during his India visit to discuss the following topics:
	1.	Metrics Onboarding Automation
	•	End-to-end automation for Kafka, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MSSQL metrics onboarding
	•	Significant reduction in manual effort for middleware and observability platform teams
	2.	Open Source Alternatives to ThousandEyes
	•	Exploration of cost-effective and scalable open-source or hybrid solutions for synthetic transaction and network monitoring

These topics align with broader efforts around platform efficiency and cost optimization, and I’d appreciate the opportunity to share insights and roadmap alignment with Todd.

Please let me know a convenient slot during his visit.
