Subject: Monitoring Gaps Identified in Aternity Agent Availability – Action Plan Initiated

Dear [Leadership/Team],

We have identified a monitoring gap concerning the Aternity agents deployed on client machines. In certain scenarios, the Aternity agent fails to report its availability status. This is primarily due to client systems being shut down or the agent entering a dormant state.

To strengthen our endpoint visibility, we have initiated a cross-verification strategy by correlating Aternity agent status with other active endpoint agents such as CrowdStrike and Qualys. Initial analysis indicates that in several cases, the Aternity agent is not active while either CrowdStrike or Qualys agents are still reporting as active on the same machine.

Next Steps:
	•	We are implementing a correlation logic across endpoint telemetry to flag mismatches where Aternity is inactive but other agents are active.
	•	A remediation plan will be developed to proactively restart or revalidate Aternity agents based on this correlation.
	•	Ongoing dashboards and reports will be shared to track improvement and agent stability.

This initiative will enhance our end-user monitoring accuracy, reduce blind spots, and ensure better alignment with our endpoint protection ecosystem.

Please let me know if you’d like a deep dive on the technical approach or wish to review the dashboards we’re developing.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Principal Engineer – Observability & Automation
