Jira Ticket: [BFZH-3676] Migrate Custom Metrics Servers into New Data Center – NONPROD

Intended Value & Expected Outcome
	•	Goal:
Seamlessly migrate custom metrics collection infrastructure for NONPROD from the legacy data center to the new data center.
	•	Value:
Ensure uninterrupted metrics collection for process and service monitoring in NONPROD environments, especially those generated via AutoSys. This supports observability continuity and compliance for mission-critical services.
	•	Outcome:
	•	Metrics from custom process and service monitors (AutoSys-based) are ingested successfully into Grafana Cloud post-migration.
	•	All integrations, dashboards, and alerts remain functional and consistent with pre-migration state.
	•	Infrastructure is ready for production-like testing and validation in the new data center.

⸻

Phases
	1.	Inventory custom metrics servers and validate metric generation (AutoSys-based).
	2.	Prepare the new data center environment and replicate necessary configurations (jobs, exporters, firewalls, routes).
	3.	Update scrape targets in Grafana Agent or Prometheus configurations to point to new servers.
	4.	Perform controlled switchover with metric flow verification in Grafana Cloud.
	5.	Validate dashboard visualizations and alerting rules.
	6.	Roll back if discrepancies are observed, or promote as standard NONPROD setup.
	7.	Document steps and lessons learned for PROD migration.

⸻

Testability & Feasibility
	•	Testability:
Compare metric continuity (names, values, labels) before and after migration using side-by-side dashboard verification.
	•	Feasibility:
Proven approach used for previous LOB migrations, with reusable configs and Grafana integrations.

⸻

Dependencies
	•	Network connectivity between new data center and Grafana Cloud
	•	Autosys job execution in the new environment
	•	Config access to Grafana Agents or Prometheus nodes

⸻

Risks & Unknowns
	•	Risk:
AutoSys jobs may require reconfiguration or elevated privileges in new data center.
	•	Unknown:
Latency or connectivity issues during initial testing phase could impact metrics delivery.

⸻

Technology Partners
	•	Infra & Network Teams (New DC Setup)
	•	Autosys Job Owners
	•	Observability SMEs
	•	Grafana Engineering Team

⸻

Performance & Nonfunctional Requirements
	•	Metrics delivery from new DC must match old setup in terms of frequency, latency, and completeness.
	•	Alert reliability and dashboard performance must be equivalent to legacy DC metrics source
