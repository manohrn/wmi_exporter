Intended Value & Expected Outcome
	•	Goal:
Enable forecasting of application metrics for the GRFCL application via Grafana Cloud using advanced visualization and modeling capabilities.
	•	Value:
Support proactive capacity planning and operational readiness by visualizing trends and forecasting future metrics behavior for GRFCL. This initiative aligns with enterprise metrics enhancements for predictive observability.
	•	Outcome:
Forecast panels are available in Grafana dashboards using built-in features (e.g., Holt-Winters, Prophet, or Grafana Machine Learning plugin). These panels support leadership with data-driven planning based on projected usage patterns.

⸻

Phases
	1.	Identify key metrics for GRFCL that require forecasting (e.g., CPU, memory, Kafka lag).
	2.	Enable forecast visualization using Grafana’s built-in statistical functions or ML plugin.
	3.	Tag and organize metrics for GRFCL to ensure clean input data to forecasting logic.
	4.	Validate forecast accuracy against real historical data.
	5.	Document setup for potential reuse by other app IDs.

⸻

Testability & Feasibility
	•	Testability:
Forecast accuracy will be validated by comparing predicted vs. actual values over a 7-day period.
	•	Feasibility:
Grafana Cloud supports out-of-the-box and plugin-based forecasting, making the implementation feasible with minimal setup.

⸻

Dependencies
	•	Grafana Cloud forecast plugins (optional).
	•	Accurate historical data ingested in Mimir or Prometheus backend.

⸻

Risks & Unknowns
	•	Risk:
Inconsistent or missing historical data could degrade forecast accuracy.
	•	Unknown:
Behavior of custom business metrics under forecast model logic may vary.

⸻

Technology Partners
	•	Grafana Engineering SME
	•	Observability Platform Team
	•	Forecasting/AI Plugin Owners (if applicable)

⸻

Performance & Nonfunctional Requirements
	•	Dashboards must load forecast panels within 2 seconds under normal usage.
	•	Forecast models should support update frequency of every 24 hours for fresh predictions.
