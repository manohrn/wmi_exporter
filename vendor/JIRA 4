Description:
This story captures ongoing BAU (Break/Fix and support) responsibilities handled during Sprint 2025-S11. These tasks are critical for maintaining operational efficiency and stakeholder satisfaction.

The scope of this story includes:
	•	Assisting engineering team members with development or environment blockers
	•	Reviewing and supporting production deployment activities
	•	Addressing and prioritizing any reported vulnerabilities
	•	Responding to and resolving customer queries related to metrics and Grafana Cloud
	•	Supporting migration efforts from legacy ITRS monitoring to the Prometheus/Grafana stack

⸻

Design:
Not applicable (operational BAU task). Optionally, attach a process flow for incident support or deployment review.

⸻

Technical Implementation:
	•	Provide technical consultation to engineers on blockers and implementation challenges
	•	Participate in production deployment planning and validation
	•	Review and triage vulnerability reports, coordinate fixes with relevant teams
	•	Engage with end-users/customers to resolve queries and provide updates
	•	Guide ITRS-to-Prometheus metric mapping and orchestration as needed
	•	Log hours and categorize work (support, fix, guidance) for BAU reporting

⸻

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	At least 1 production deployment reviewed or supported successfully
	•	Any critical or high vulnerabilities assigned and mitigated within SLA
	•	Customer queries responded to within agreed response times
	•	At least one active support session for ITRS migration conducted
	•	Peer feedback confirms availability and guidance throughout the sprint
	•	BAU efforts documented in team tracking tool or sprint notes
