To check the status of alerts (whether they are suppressed or active) via Mimir tools or the Alertmanager API, you can follow these steps:

Using Mimir Tools

	1.	Install Mimir Tools: Ensure you have Mimir tools installed.

go install github.com/grafana/mimir/tools/...


	2.	Query Alertmanager for Alert Status: Use Mimir tools to query the Alertmanager API and retrieve the status of alerts. Here is an example command:

mimirtool alert list -u http://<alertmanager-ip>:<alertmanager-port>/api/v2/alerts

	2.	This command fetches a list of alerts from Alertmanager. You can then inspect the output to check the status of each alert.

Using Alertmanager API Directly

	1.	Query Alerts: You can directly query the Alertmanager API to get the status of alerts. Use the following API endpoint to fetch all alerts:

curl http://<alertmanager-ip>:<alertmanager-port>/api/v2/alerts

	1.	This returns a JSON array of all alerts, including their status.
	2.	Filter and Check Status: Look for the status field in the JSON response. The status field will indicate whether the alert is active or suppressed.

Here is an example of what the JSON response might look like:

[
  {
    "status": {
      "state": "active",  // Can be "active" or "suppressed"
      "silencedBy": [],
      "inhibitedBy": []
    },
    "labels": {
      "alertname": "TestAlert",
      "severity": "critical",
      "instance": "test-instance"
    },
    "annotations": {
      "summary": "This is a test alert"
    },
    "startsAt": "2024-06-26T00:00:00Z",
    "endsAt": "2024-06-26T01:00:00Z",
    "generatorURL": "http://example.com"
  }
]

	•	state: Indicates whether the alert is active or suppressed.
	•	silencedBy: Lists the IDs of any silences that are affecting this alert.
	•	inhibitedBy: Lists the IDs of any inhibition rules that are affecting this alert.

Example Command for Curl

To check the status of alerts directly using curl, you can use a command like this:

curl -s http://localhost:9093/api/v2/alerts | jq '.[] | {alertname: .labels.alertname, state: .status.state, silencedBy: .status.silencedBy, inhibitedBy: .status.inhibitedBy}'

This command fetches the alerts and uses jq to filter and display relevant fields.

Summary

Using Mimir tools or directly querying the Alertmanager API allows you to retrieve the status of your alerts and determine if they are active or suppressed.
