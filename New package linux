To update the script and service name to toolkit_exporter, follow these steps:

	1.	Create the Python Script:
Ensure your Python script named toolkit_exporter.py is located in a suitable directory. For this example, we’ll assume it’s located at /home/grfclagt/toolkit_exporter.py.
	2.	Create a Systemd Service File:
Create a systemd service file to run your script. You’ll need superuser privileges to create this file.

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/toolkit_exporter.service

	2.	Add the following content to the file:

[Unit]
Description=Toolkit Exporter Python Script
After=network.target

[Service]
User=grfclagt
WorkingDirectory=/home/grfclagt
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/grfclagt/toolkit_exporter.py
Restart=always
StandardOutput=append:/opt/grfclagt/log/toolkit.log
StandardError=append:/opt/grfclagt/log/toolkit.log

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


	3.	Reload Systemd and Start the Service:
Reload systemd to recognize the new service, start it, and enable it to run at boot.

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start toolkit_exporter.service
sudo systemctl enable toolkit_exporter.service


	4.	Set Up Log Rotation:
Create a logrotate configuration file to rotate logs every 2 days. Create the file with the following command:

sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/toolkit_exporter

	4.	Add the following content:

/opt/grfclagt/log/toolkit.log {
    daily
    rotate 2
    compress
    missingok
    notifempty
    create 0640 grfclagt adm
    postrotate
        systemctl restart toolkit_exporter.service > /dev/null
    endscript
}


	5.	Ensure the Log Directory Exists and is Writable:
Make sure the directory /opt/grfclagt/log/ exists and is writable by the grfclagt user.

sudo mkdir -p /opt/grfclagt/log
sudo chown grfclagt:grfclagt /opt/grfclagt/log


	6.	Restart Systemd and Logrotate:
Restart systemd and logrotate to ensure everything is properly configured.

sudo systemctl restart toolkit_exporter.service
sudo logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/toolkit_exporter



With these steps, your toolkit_exporter.py script will run as a systemd service under the grfclagt account, and logs will be stored in /opt/grfclagt/log/toolkit.log with rotation every 2 days.
