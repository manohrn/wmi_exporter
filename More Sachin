I recommend focusing on accountability, timely task completion, and consistent communication. Proactively updating stakeholders and ensuring closure on assigned items will significantly improve collaboration and reduce escalations. Adopting a structured approach to task management can also help build trust within the team.

Additionally, there is a strong need to improve involvement in development and automation tasks, which are currently lacking. Building technical depth and actively contributing to engineering solutions will create more value for the team. Enhancing problem-solving ownership, especially during escalations, and participating more actively in sprint planning and delivery cycles would lead to better team alignment and delivery outcomes.
