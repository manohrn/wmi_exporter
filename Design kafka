Here is a cleaner version of the architecture flow diagram, focusing on clarity and simplicity:

	1.	Mimir API:
	•	Data Source: Collect metrics for both Windows and Linux systems.
	•	Endpoints: Specific endpoints for Windows and Linux metrics.
	2.	Scheduler:
	•	Regular Intervals: A scheduler to query the Mimir API at regular intervals.
	•	Tasks: Separate tasks for querying Windows and Linux metrics.
	3.	Data Collector:
	•	API Client: Interfaces with the Mimir API to fetch metrics.
	•	Error Handling: Handles retries and errors during API calls.
	4.	Data Processor:
	•	Parser: Parses the JSON response from the API.
	•	Transformation: Transforms the data into the desired format for Kafka.
	5.	Kafka Producer:
	•	Windows Metrics Topic: Writes Windows metrics to a specific Kafka topic.
	•	Linux Metrics Topic: Writes Linux metrics to a different Kafka topic.
	•	Configuration: Configures Kafka producer properties (e.g., brokers, topic names).

Refined Diagram Layout

	1.	Mimir API:
	•	Box labeled “Mimir API” with two arrows labeled “Windows Metrics Endpoint” and “Linux Metrics Endpoint”.

	2.	Scheduler:
	•	Box labeled “Scheduler” connected to “Data Collector” with arrows indicating regular intervals for each metric type.
	3.	Data Collector:
	•	Box labeled “Data Collector” with arrows to “Mimir API” endpoints.
	•	Arrows from “Data Collector” to “Data Processor”.
	4.	Data Processor:
	•	Box labeled “Data Processor” with arrows from “Data Collector”.
	•	Arrows from “Data Processor” to “Kafka Producer”.
	5.	Kafka Producer:
	•	Box labeled “Kafka Producer”.
	•	Two arrows from “Kafka Producer” to “Kafka Topics” labeled “Windows Metrics Topic” and “Linux Metrics Topic”.
