To fit the key points into a single slide under four different quadrants, we’ll further condense and organize the information. Here’s a structured approach with the four quadrants:

Slide Title: Demonstrating Technical Leadership and Impact

Quadrant 1: Deep Technical Expertise

	•	Led OVO migration with $20M in cost savings and 90% ownership of the engineering work.
	•	Architected solution processing 120M series/min, supporting Linux, IIS, Kafka, PostgreSQL, and more.
	•	Integrated Prometheus, Cribl, completing BP ATOps and ML certifications.
	•	Delivered critical EPLX metrics, enabling real-time forecasting and outlier detection.

Quadrant 2: Automation & Efficiency Gains

	•	Reduced agent issues by 58 incidents/day and automated switch handling for 500+ tickets.
	•	Spearheaded network automation, cutting manual efforts across teams and reducing ETA by 30 mins.
	•	Deployed self-service automations via MSP Service Portal, reducing team dependencies.
	•	Integrated alerting solutions for smoother incident response across multiple platforms.

Quadrant 3: Innovation and Leadership

	•	Pioneered metrics optimization and observability enhancements using Cribl and Dynatrace.
	•	Trained teams on Metrics, SCOM, and BMC Truesight to automate and reduce manual operations.
	•	Led cross-team automation initiatives, streamlining operational workflows and reducing response time.
	•	Drove innovations in outlier detection, helping preempt system failures.

Quadrant 4: Communication & Business Impact

	•	Represented observability products at CTO Developer Day and platform strategy meetings.
	•	Reduced manual efforts by 30 minutes for config solutions and improved ticket handling across NetOps and Cloud teams.
	•	Collaborated with leadership to shape observability strategy and drive critical metrics automation.
	•	Designed presentations for global developer teams, influencing US teams’ principal engineer efforts.

This structure helps convey your accomplishments and impact concisely across four key areas, perfect for a single slide. Let me know if you’d like further adjustments!
