## **Correlation-Based Monitoring Use Cases with Observability Tools**

### **1. Detecting Service Dependency Failures**

**Scenario:** Wells Fargo’s online banking platform is experiencing intermittent failures when customers try to check their account balances.

**Action:** Correlation-based monitoring is employed to examine dependencies between the account balance service and other microservices, such as authentication and transaction history.

**Observability Tools:**
- **Prometheus**: Monitors real-time metrics of microservices, including request rates, error rates, and latency, to identify abnormal patterns in the authentication service.
- **Elastic APM**: Provides distributed tracing and detailed performance monitoring of requests across microservices, helping to pinpoint bottlenecks within the authentication service.
- **Grafana**: Visualizes the correlated data, showing that the increased latency in the account balance service is linked to the overload on the authentication service.

**Outcome:** The monitoring system identifies that the root cause of the failures is an overload on the authentication service, which is delaying user credential verification. The issue is quickly resolved by increasing the capacity of the authentication service, restoring normal service for customers.

### **2. Root Cause Analysis of Customer Support Spikes**

**Scenario:** Wells Fargo’s customer support center is experiencing a sudden spike in calls related to failed wire transfers.

**Action:** Correlation-based monitoring is used to connect customer support logs with real-time system metrics, including transaction logs, network performance, and database queries.

**Observability Tools:**
- **Elasticsearch (part of the ELK Stack)**: Aggregates logs from various systems, including transaction and customer support logs, to correlate wire transfer failures with specific system events.
- **Kibana**: Visualizes log data, helping to identify that the spike in wire transfer failures is linked to a recent network configuration change.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Monitor and visualize network performance metrics, confirming increased latency in critical API calls.
- **Elastic APM**: Traces the entire transaction flow, revealing where delays occur and linking them to the recent network configuration change.

**Outcome:** The system identifies that the spike in failed wire transfers corresponds with a recent network configuration change that inadvertently increased latency for critical API calls. The IT team reverts the configuration, reducing wire transfer failures and alleviating the burden on customer support.

### **3. Correlation of User Experience with Backend Performance**

**Scenario:** Users of Wells Fargo’s mobile app report slow load times for account summary pages.

**Action:** Correlation-based monitoring links front-end performance metrics (e.g., page load times, user session data) with backend metrics (e.g., database response times, API latency).

**Observability Tools:**
- **New Relic or Datadog**: Collects and correlates front-end performance metrics with backend service metrics to provide a comprehensive view of the user experience.
- **Prometheus**: Monitors backend metrics, particularly database query performance, which is suspected to be causing slow load times.
- **Elastic APM**: Traces the request flow from the mobile app through the backend, identifying delays in specific database queries impacting the user experience.

**Outcome:** The monitoring system discovers that the slow load times are due to increased database query times caused by a newly deployed feature that performs additional complex queries. The IT team optimizes these queries, resulting in faster load times and an improved user experience.

### **4. Detecting Anomalies in ATM Network Performance**

**Scenario:** Certain ATMs across multiple regions are experiencing delays in processing transactions, leading to customer frustration.

**Action:** Correlation-based monitoring aggregates data from the ATM network, including transaction logs, connectivity status, and regional network traffic.

**Observability Tools:**
- **Prometheus**: Monitors network performance metrics of ATM connections, tracking packet loss, latency, and uptime across different regions.
- **Elasticsearch & Kibana**: Aggregate and visualize transaction logs and connectivity status, helping to identify patterns related to network issues.
- **Grafana**: Provides dashboards to correlate network performance data with ATM transaction delays, pinpointing regional issues.
- **Elastic APM**: Tracks the performance of network-dependent services across ATMs, correlating regional delays with specific network performance anomalies.

**Outcome:** The system correlates the delays with a regional network provider experiencing high packet loss during peak hours. Wells Fargo works with the provider to resolve the issue or reroutes ATM traffic through alternative networks, improving transaction speeds and reliability.

### **5. Monitoring for Compliance with Regulatory Requirements**

**Scenario:** Wells Fargo needs to ensure compliance with financial regulations that mandate timely reporting of large transactions to regulatory bodies.

**Action:** Correlation-based monitoring tracks transaction processing times and correlates these with the times transactions are reported to regulators.

**Observability Tools:**
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Monitor transaction processing times and visualize the correlation between when a transaction is processed and when it is reported.
- **Elasticsearch**: Aggregates logs from reporting services, providing a searchable history to ensure compliance with reporting timelines.
- **Elastic APM**: Tracks the lifecycle of transactions from initiation through reporting, ensuring each step occurs within the required timeframe.
- **Alerting Systems (e.g., PagerDuty)**: Integrated with Prometheus to trigger alerts if delays in reporting are detected.

**Outcome:** The system detects that some large transactions are being reported later than required due to delays in the batch reporting process following a software update. The issue is identified and resolved before any non-compliance penalties are incurred, ensuring Wells Fargo’s adherence to regulatory standards.

### **6. Identifying the Source of Data Inconsistencies Across Systems**

**Scenario:** Data discrepancies are discovered between Wells Fargo’s customer relationship management (CRM) system and its transaction processing system.

**Action:** Correlation-based monitoring cross-references data entries between the CRM and transaction processing systems, along with logs from data synchronization processes.

**Observability Tools:**
- **Prometheus**: Tracks synchronization metrics and performance data from both the CRM and transaction processing systems.
- **Elasticsearch & Kibana**: Aggregate and visualize logs from data synchronization jobs, highlighting any errors or discrepancies.
- **Elastic APM**: Traces the data flow between systems, identifying where discrepancies originate during synchronization processes.

**Outcome:** The monitoring reveals that the inconsistencies correlate with a specific ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) job that failed intermittently due to an unhandled exception. The issue is traced back to a recent change in the data schema that wasn’t properly accounted for in the ETL job. Fixing the ETL process resolves the data inconsistencies.

### **7. Correlating Security Events with System Performance**

**Scenario:** Wells Fargo notices a pattern of periodic slowdowns in its online banking service, coinciding with security alerts for unusual login attempts.

**Action:** Correlation-based monitoring connects performance metrics with security event logs, including firewall activity, failed login attempts, and system resource utilization.

**Observability Tools:**
- **Elasticsearch**: Aggregates and searches security logs, including firewall and login attempt data.
- **Grafana**: Visualizes the correlation between security alerts and system performance metrics, identifying potential connections between the two.
- **Prometheus**: Monitors resource utilization (e.g., CPU, memory) to determine whether security events are impacting system performance.
- **Elastic APM**: Traces user sessions and login attempts, identifying patterns indicative of potential security breaches and their impact on system performance.

**Outcome:** The system correlates the slowdowns with a series of brute-force login attempts that are overloading the authentication service. By identifying the source of the attacks and implementing rate limiting, the IT team mitigates the issue, improving system performance and security.

### **Summary of Observability Tools Used**

- **Prometheus:** For real-time monitoring of metrics across services, tracking performance, resource utilization, and alerting on anomalies.
